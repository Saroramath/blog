<h2>Chapter one: Introduction </h2>

The chapter covers the various aspects of statistical learning. It covers the historical development of the methods. It also covers different types of problems where the statistical methods can be useful. In particular, the expected prdiction could be a numerical value, a categorification or trends.And how different methods helps us to make those predictions. One of the most popular methods is linear regression. With the computational advance we can afford to apply non-linear regression. To categorise, clustering and k-neighbourghood method, works good. We should do the clustering with all different parameters of distance.
