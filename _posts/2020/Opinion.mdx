The idea emerged when scrolling through the comments on a shared post about a public poily on a local Facebook group. Someone had shared their opinion about how the issue directly impacted single women parent more adversily. And the comment section trailed over with people discrediting the argument with,
some balmed over . Sadly all this was unwarrented, 

 about an local policy being implemented, where someone had mentioned that women were more affected by that policy and that was follwed by a series of comments, some of them decrditing it by claiming it wasn't backed up actaual data, and some even geeting to critisism and name calling. It was dishartening to see it. I went to websites of statistics NL and studied the data provided and learnt that she was absolutely right and anyone claimimg that there was no data supporting her claims were all completely wrong. 
For a while I have been bouncing-off this idea with my parter towards the need of a public engagement platform that promote inclusive and supportive discussion regarding the public and muncipal policies and has all data available at that platform.
Two things:
1. It encourages supportive and positive discussion and disvalue the negative remrks
2. It has all the data and information about local region available to fcilitate the conversation.

This public engaement platform aims to bring together community in a coommon, safe space where they can discuss and influence local poltics by engaging in a healthy and inclusive environment. They have up to date knowledge of the demographic data regading wages, food security, gender .., 

It is amazing to see a lot of people interested in national and global politics but there is still a lot of room to increase that participation at the local level, and which I beieve is more nstrumental in bringing change. 
There is a lot of potential to engage people with diverseexpertise to make our communities better.
