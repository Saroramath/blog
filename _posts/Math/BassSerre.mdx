A graph of groups is data $\Delta =(\Gamma,\{G_v\},\{G_e\})$, where $\Gamma$ is a graph with a group $G_v$ for each vertex $v$ and a group $G_e$ for each edge $e$.
 There are injective homomorphisms $\phi: G_e \to G_v$. 
There is a fundamental group $\pi(\Delta)$ defined as a group with the presentation
