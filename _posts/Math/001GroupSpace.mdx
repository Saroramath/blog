The algebraic structures like groups can be studied in an interesting way by studying spaces associated to them. In particular we can study the action of groups on these spaces to tell something about the group.




> **Group-Action** : The group action of a group $G$ on a space $X$ is a homomorphism from $\phi: G \to Isom(X)$. The action is said to be _faithful_ if the homomorphism is injective.

For many nice actions, we can recover the information about the group and space from the quotient space.
